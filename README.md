# ClickAndDrag
This task is from the challenge "30 projects in 30 days", in which I made `Click and Drag Panels` on vanilla JS. You can use it for your own purposes.


### Quickstart
You can see the working UI/UX of this task by the link: https://khanevich.github.io/ClickAndDrag/

### Create a new project based on the ClickAndDrag
Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., ClickAndDrag).
``` bash
git clone https://khanevich.github.io/ClickAndDrag/ ClickAndDrag
cd ClickAndDrag
```
